# Comprehensive_Formula-1_Race_Analysis-Team_Performance_and_Financial_Insights_-1950-2023

Project Overview:

Objective: To analyze Formula 1 race data from 1950 to 2023, focusing on team performance and financial insights.
Outcome: Uncovered significant financial gaps, illustrated the evolution of teams, and provided actionable insights through comprehensive data visualization.
Step-by-Step Process:

Data Collection:
Collected multiple datasets from various sources, including race results, team financials, driver statistics, and historical data.

Data Cleaning and Preparation:

Connecting Different Files:
Merged multiple CSV files containing race results, team data, and financial records.
Data Cleaning: Removed duplicates, handled missing values, and standardized data formats.
Normalization: Normalized numerical data to ensure consistency across different datasets.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Data Visualization in Tableau:
Created dashboards to visualize race results, team performance, and financial trends.
Used bar charts, line graphs, and scatter plots to illustrate key metrics and patterns.
Implemented filters and interactive elements to allow users to explore data by season, team, and driver.
Statistical Analysis: Performed correlation analysis to identify relationships between team performance and financial investments.
Key Findings:

Performance Metrics: Identified top-performing teams and drivers across different eras.
Financial Insights: Revealed significant financial gaps between teams, highlighting the impact of budget on performance.
Historical Trends: Illustrated the evolution of teams, showing how certain teams have consistently performed over the decades.
